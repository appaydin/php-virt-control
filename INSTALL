Installation Instructions
*************************

To install php-virt-control you need a webserver that
supports PHP and also you have to have the libvirt-php
module installed to your PHP (or php-libvirt if you're
using Fedora). You can download the module directly from
the official libvirt-php website at:

http://libvirt.org/php

or you can use yum to download and install it for you
if you are using Fedora 14 or higher version. Both
i386 and x86_64 versions are supported.

If you have the libvirt-php module already loaded in your
PHP configuration you can install either the RPM package
provided or you can manually set your Apache/webserver
configuration to point to the directory where you have
copy of php-virt-control scripts located.

Note: Fedora name is php-libvirt, and not libvirt-php so
      to install the package you need to issue the
      "yum install php-libvirt" command instead.

Configuration
*************

The configuration for php-virt-control resides in
/etc/php-virt-control/connection.php and optionally
/etc/php-virt-control/mysql-connection.php files to
define the database storage connection type with
appropriate configuration.
